# Monte Carlo Simulation
Author: Brigilda Lleshi

## Summary
The goal of this challenge is to create two financial planners:
1. A financial planner for emergencies, in which credit union members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.
2. A financial planner for retirement to forecast the performance of member retirement portfolios in 30 years. This part will be done utilizing an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
